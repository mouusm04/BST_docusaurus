  "description": "Drayman component instances live inside separate processes. They can communicate with each other via EventHub or browser using Browser object. But in some cases this won't be enough. For example, if you want to connect to the database, a database connection must be established during each component's initialization which will lead to a lot of overhead. Another example would be if some variable needs to be shared between all component instances.",
